# Karina Finegan Online CV/Portfolio

## Code Institute - First Milestone Project: *User Centric Frontend Development.*

This static website is being developed to showcase *Karina Finegan's* resume in an efficient and appealing online format.

---
## UX

- Target users are two-fold: Employers & Recruiters.
- Targeted much the same way. Except perhaps recruiters are less interested in site content and more interested in having a CV to download and take-away.
- Employers are more likely to want to browse the online resume and connected accounts.

### User Stories

#### Tech Recruiters

* I have many clients who are looking for developers. I'd like to be able to quickly browse an online resume to get a sense of whether or not this particular developer might be a good fit for any of my clients.

* As a tech recruiter I'm not 100% sure what languages or tools my client requires, so I would like the ability to download a detailed CV that clearly stipulates all skills. 

#### Employers

* As an employer looking for a new full stack developer to join my team, I find online resumes incredibly useful to get a broad sense of someone's capabilities. 

* I might then download a more detailed CV before deciding whether to call that candidate for interview.

* As an employer looking for a new front end developer, I am heartened to see the online resumes of potential candidates because it is an instant assurance that they know how to design and build a website. 

#### Applicable to both target users

* As a user I would like to view this candidate's work history.

* As a user I would like to know what languages this candidate is able to work in.

* As a user I would like to see other projects this candidate has developed.


### Strategy
The focus for this project was to create a professional and slick online CV for Karina Finegan, that was carefully balanced between usability and design. The pull towards style over structure is strong in anyone with a design background and because this website is geared towards a number of differnt kinds of employers (not just front end) it is important to reign in any gallop towards flamboyant untethered design. 

Essentially the website must demonstate good design principles and use of colour, but its primary goal is to *communicate* information about Karina to potential employers. In order for that communication to be effective, the site needs to be structured well and easily accessible.

The content must be relevant to the user stories and in particular it should steer clear of too much non-essential personal information. 

### Scope
The project had a clearly defined scope from its inception, as there is a clearly defined framework for CVs and the goal was to place that online: 

Information about Karina, her education and employment history, her skillset, projects she has worked on and a way to contact her. 

### Structure
As the site is not overly complicated, it will feature a fixed navigation that connects the user to each of the sections on one long scrolling page. 

The sections are as follows:

* Home/Index (landing page)
* Work History
* Skills   
* Selected Projects 
* Contact 

In addition to these main pages, there is the ability to download a tradition CV in .pdf format.

There is also the option of downloading particular project design files.


### Skeleton

### Surface

#### Colour Palette
The colour palette chosen for this project was primarily dark toned with an almost fluorescent green/yellow accent colour. 

#### Typography
I wanted to use only sans-serif fonts to enhance the minimalist bold style I've gone with. 



## Features

* Navigation Bar - Fixed Bootstrap Navbar.

* Home / Index Page

* Short Bio

* Work History

* Skills

* Selected Projects

* Contact Page

## Accessibility

* My original design had far more dark on dark toned elements, which I love the look of, but after having checked the site and colour themes using the Web Disability Simulator,
I realised my colour choices were problematic for some potential users. So I chose to use more of the light grey and yellow tones for text elements. 

## Future Features to Implement

* I plan to turn this website into a dynamic site, whereby specific project pages are generated dynamically after inputting certain key variables. Title, goal, colour palette, images etc... (Example in wireframe).

* I plan to implement the sequential loading of elements on scroll. So as the user scrolls down elements pop into view.

#### [Will Chow's jQuery Code.](https://jsfiddle.net/wilchow/4hzenxkh/) 
The jQuery code I used and altered to display the Work History Timeline information on hover/click.  

#### [@dynamyc-2's jQuery code](https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/jquery-window-width-condition/)
I used and altered the first line from this user's question on CSS Tricks.

#### [MatuDuke's Code from Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9707021/how-do-i-auto-hide-placeholder-text-upon-focus-using-css-or-jquery/9707068#9707068)
I used this user's answer (2nd from the top) to hide the placeholder text in my contact form when the user clicks to type something, as I think it's off-putting when the placeholder 
text remains until you actually type.
